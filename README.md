Credit Score Prediction
📝 Introduction
Credit score prediction is an essential tool for evaluating an individual’s creditworthiness. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict credit scores based on various socio-economic and financial features. The goal is to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

✨ Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and normalizes numerical features.
Model Training: Implements multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
Evaluation Metrics: Analyzes model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
Feature Selection: Identifies key features influencing credit score prediction.
🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or above.
Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
